CSS - Cascading style sheets
	- we can provide a style to a html element
	- we can keep the styling seperate from the content and it's structure
	
3 ways to provide styling
	- external styles
		- are specified in external files with .css extension and linked to the html file
	- internal styles
		- are specified within the html file in a common place
	- inline styles
		- is specified along with the element that you want to style
		- we use a style attribute here
		- not preferred much

				text-decoration: underline;
				background-color: red; 
			}
